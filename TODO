TODO List
---------

-Physicians per Department (Might need to be demoed?)

-Billing
--Should probably have a DB of bills for record keeping. Also, status(pending, payed, etc.)

-Only 1 address for each phys and pat

-Communication
--Pull information from EMR
--Send and receive information from the insurance group

-Health codes

-Aesthetics
--Boxes around nested forms (Phone type and number should be visually grouped)

-Move this TODO list to actual issues on Github so they can be assigned and worked on by us.

-In the form for each model, instead of id combo boxes, drop downs of actual names would be better.

-Show emails for staffers

-Remove middle name column. Unused by seed data.

-Schedules index. Only show next future, and next 3 months instead of all. It's too huge to render quickly.

-Physician show, filter blocks by some designated time length. Also, only show next 3 months?
