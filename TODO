TODO List
---------

-Emergency Contact

-Physicians per Department (Might need to be demoed?)

-Billing
--Should probably have a DB of bills for record keeping. Also, status
   (pending, payed, etc.)

-Only 1 address for each phys and pat

-Communication
--Pull information from EMR
--Send and receive information from the insurance group

-Health codes

-Aesthetics
--Boxes around nested forms (Phone type and number should be visually grouped)

-Seeds.rb issue - Times don't match when parsed. Must be a time zone issue?

-Move this TODO list to actual issues on Github so they can be assigned and worked on by us.

-In the form for each model, instead of id combo boxes, drop downs of actual names would be better.
